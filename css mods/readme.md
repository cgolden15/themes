# CSS Mods
CSS mods/snippets are small portions of CSS code that change how discord appears. For example, it can remove server discovery or hide profile badges! Here I have a collection of a few helpful snippets for use in combination with my themes.

## How to use
After you have enabled your theme through the theme menu, do the following:
1. Navigate to "Custom CSS" 
2. Paste the code snippet of your choice into the box. Click Save, then update.
